    Zach Hurd is a Maine native who has been honing his craft in Brooklyn, NY for the past 7 years. Hurd's 2013 EP, "She Never Sleeps", recently won "Best Pop EP" in the Independent Music Awards. He has continued to broaden his audience through captivating performances and by blurring the lines between folk, soul, pop and americana. After a successful Kickstarter campaign from his fans, Hurd is currently working on his 4th album set to be released this fall.

  <p class="f3 serif">Thank you all so much for the amazing support over the last few weeks. I've basically been living on Cloud 9 for the past couple of days. THANK YOU! I can't wait to get back into the studio. The fact that we went over the goal is going to make this album that much better. You never know what kind of road blocks you can hit when making, or promoting, an album, so having some financial breathing room is a huge help. I'll definitely be keeping you updated on the progress of the project. Thank you so much for being a part of it. I can't wait to share it with you. Talk to you soon!</p>

  <p class="f3 serif">I've been working on my 4th album over the past few months and now it's ready for the studio. I'm really excited about this one. For those of you who don't know, and I'm sure most of you do, making an album can be a big challenge financially. So for this album I'm asking for your help. When you have a minute, stop by my Kickstarter page where you can check out a short video about the project (it even gives a very quick tour through the studio). There are also a bunch of incentives to go along with each donation. *Thank you, in advance, for supporting this album! Here's the link: Zach Hurd - 4th Studio Album</p>
